This document serves as the functional description of Bendu in that it:

- Describes the language scenarios through examples,
- Acts as the definitive guide for the language's behavior, and
- Is the automated test pack for the language.

It is rather helpful in that, as the implementation evolves, the scenarios can be used to verify that the implementations are not introducing any new defects.  It should be pointed out the this document will also show off the error scenarios as well as the successful scenarios.

Let's get started.

```bendu-repl
> let x = 42
42

> x
42
```
